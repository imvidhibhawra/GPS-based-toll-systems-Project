# GPS-based-toll-systems-Project
This project aims to simulate a toll-based system using GPS coordinates. Vehicles are tracked as they move through a road network, and tolls are deducted from their balances when they enter predefined toll zones. The simulation uses Python libraries for geospatial data handling and visualization.
